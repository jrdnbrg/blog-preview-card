### What I learned

I learned about the difference between variable fonts and static fonts. I now know the advantages of using variable fonts and I will be using them going forward.

Besides, I focused on accessiblity and using the correct semantic HTML elements. I feel like I now have a better understanding of when to use certain elements.
